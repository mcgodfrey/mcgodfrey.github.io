This is the first post on my power supply build. Also see [part II](http://dangerfromdeer.com/2016/04/06/bench-power-supply-build-part-ii/) and the Circuitmaker [project page](http://workspace.circuitmaker.com/Projects/F48BC6C2-9005-48B8-87CD-C89CD40F70DC). An adjustable bench power supply has been on my list of things to build for quite a while. A linear supply should be relatively simple to design, with the added bonus of being a useful thing to have around. My goals with this project are to design and build a slightly more complex system than I have in the past, to lean to use PCB layout software and to actually get a PCB designed and manufactured. I wanted to design it from scratch, rather than using an adjustable 3 terminal regulator or a controller chip with everything built in - this is supposed to be a learning experience more than anything else. My requirements are:

- 0-30V adjustable voltage
- 0-2A with current limiting.
- Separate fixed 5V output for powering digital circuits.
