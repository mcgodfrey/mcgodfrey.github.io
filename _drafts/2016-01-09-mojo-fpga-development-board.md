This post is part of my series on building a kinetic sculpture with the Mojo FPGA development board. (Part1 [Part2](http://dangerfromdeer.com/2016/03/06/servo-motor-control-with-mojo-fpga-board/)) Back at uni I did a course on digital logic design ([COMP3222](http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2013/COMP3222.html) for anyone interested) and really enjoyed it - it was one of my favourite classes. But for some reason I never followed up on it or did any more. I think part of the reason is the relatively large cost and complexity of FPGAs compared with microcontrollers. Anyone can buy an Arduino for a few dollars and get started pretty much immediately. Not so for an FPGA. In order to pick up where I left of at uni I've ordered myself a [mojo board](https://embeddedmicro.com/products/mojo-v3.html) and plan to start getting back into some FPGA development. \[caption id="attachment\_457" align="alignnone" width="474"\]![Mojo FPGA dev board](http://dangerfromdeer.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mojo_board.png) Mojo FPGA dev board\[/caption\] [<span aria-label="Continue reading Mojo FPGA development board">(moreâ€¦)</span>](https://dangerfromdeer.com/2016/01/09/mojo-fpga-development-board/#more-414)
