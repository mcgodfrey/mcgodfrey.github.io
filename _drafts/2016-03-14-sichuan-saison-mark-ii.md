So I've been going through a nostalgia period with my brewing, and this week it was time to make another go of my Sichuan Saison. Last time, I'd used a White Labs yeast (no. 565). This time round I decided to keep it simple with a Wyeast Belle Saison packet. There were a few other changes I decided to make, here and there. One was the addition of Candy sugar, to make it have a little more kick. Another was the use of a Light malt, rather than a pilsener malt extract, lending it a little more body. ![IMG_6336.jpg](http://dangerfromdeer.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/img_6336.jpg) [<span aria-label="Continue reading Sichuan Saison: Mark II">(moreâ€¦)</span>](https://dangerfromdeer.com/2016/03/14/sichuan-saison-mark-ii/#more-612)
