This will be a quick post about the design and 3D printing of a custom enclosure for a temperature logger (see full writeup [here](http://dangerfromdeer.com/2016/03/26/temperature-logger/)) - a project which has been sitting on my table 90% finished for about a year now. I always find the enclosure to be the most time consuming and least interesting part of any project. As such an unfortunately high number of them stall at this final stage. 3D printing a custom enclosure is a much more interesting and attractive alternative to my usual approach of attacking a jiffy box with a drill and hacksaw. The box needs to hold a board roughly 90x50mm, have a slot for an SD card, 3 temperature probe input connectors, a DC jack power input, a 16x2 character LCD and 3 pushbuttons. The design was all done in Autodesk Fusion (see my previous [pos](http://dangerfromdeer.com/2015/12/10/starting-out-with-cad-autodesk-fusion/)[t](http://dangerfromdeer.com/2015/12/10/starting-out-with-cad-autodesk-fusion/)) and printed on my Printrbot 3D printer (see my previous [post](http://dangerfromdeer.com/2016/01/09/3d-printer/)). There were several iterations and test prints along the way to check sizing and tolerances and to test out some different designs. The final design can be found on my Autodesk account [here](http://a360.co/1pU2b9K).
