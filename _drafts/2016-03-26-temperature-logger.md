I have finally finished my temperature monitor and logging module, originally designed to monitor beer temperature as it is fermenting (beer, fridge and ambient temperatures). It is an Arduino-based device which measures and displays temperatures from multiple attached temperature probes and logs them to an SD card . This is an old project from last year sometime which has been sitting 95% complete, just waiting on an enclosure and some finishing touches to the code. I posted a separate post about the enclosure design and 3D print, read it [here](http://dangerfromdeer.com/2016/03/20/designing-a-3d-printed-electronics-enclosure/).
