This is the second post on my power supply build - also see [part I](http://dangerfromdeer.com/2016/01/01/bench-power-supply-build-part-1/) and the Circuitmaker [project page](http://workspace.circuitmaker.com/Projects/F48BC6C2-9005-48B8-87CD-C89CD40F70DC). The aim of this project is to design and build a linear bench power supply with adjustable current and voltage and up to 2.5A output from 0-30V. After building and testing the first version of the board I discovered a couple of issues. Most of the basic functionality worked - the voltage control, digital display, transformer tap select, etc. However, the current limiting never worked properly, there were some noise/oscillation issues and a couple of mechanical problems. So, Rev.1.1 was born which has now been tested and seems to be working nicely.
