The latest project is helping out on the farm, repairing and rebuilding after the fires at the start of the year. First job, building fences!

The first task was rebuilding a short section of fence and hanging a gate between the stockyard and one of the paddocks. This small section is needed before we can get the cattle into the stockyard for health checks, etc. A simple start, but there'll be more to come soon.
