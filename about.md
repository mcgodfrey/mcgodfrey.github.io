dangerfromdeer.com is a place for miscellaneous posts about ideas or projects that we are working, homebrewing adventures and general thoughts/review/rants. Contributors to the site are Matt (me) and Sam, with hopefully more to come. 

Posts are added sporadically as we have time and ideas, although hopefully the frequency will increase as we get better at this.
